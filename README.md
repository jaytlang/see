A simple text viewer for 'NIX terminals. Written with text editing in mind, the editor leverages WASD key bindings to navigate via one-handed operation, using otherwise vi-like primitives. Should be able to handle anything you throw at it, and has support for custom tabstops (specified at compile time), page up/down for speedy navigation, etc.

This project is still a work in progress - and I'd like to expand it to actually support editing things. Right now it's light enough to where it can be used like cat, but using 'E' as the insert-mode keybinding I'm currently implementing actual editing, saving, and even C syntax highlighting. 

I like to submit this because it's a succinct example of my coding style - rather than a more cumbersome project (such as KTPZ, my iOS kernel exploit built during a hackathon that encompasses roughly 4,000 lines of code from various authors). It's also a living project - and you can follow my progress here: https://github.com/jaytlang/see

See ya around!
